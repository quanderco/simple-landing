                <h1>QUANDER AI BUILDS 1000S OF COMPANIES</h1>

                <p>We are developing industrial-scale agentic systems that discover new ideas, build products, scale, and self-improve, automating the process of invention and company-creation itself.</p>
                
                <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
                
                <p>To accelerate the arc of human progress, value creation, and make every human an artist, creator, or explorer, and turn their ideas into companies doing what they love.</p>
                
                <h2>WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW</h2>
                
                <p>We have closed multiple Fortune 500 customers, and have raised $3mm pre-seed from Accel.</p>
                
                <p>We are hiring across multiple roles: <a href="mailto:careers@quander.ai">careers@quander.ai</a></p>
                
                <h2>QUANDER SYSTEM</h2>
                
                <p>The Quander AI system orchestrates multiple value-creation nodes, each of which exists as its own software business, each automating a function of business.</p>
                
                <h3>EXAMPLES OF NODES</h3>
                
                <p><strong>1) Hypesonic: The AI Distribution Agent:</strong> Our first product runs marketing and distribution continuously. Hypesonic's customers include: Kumon, Cloaked and Mito Health, with direct increases in ROAS of 50% to 500%.</p>
                
                <p><strong>2) Market Discovery Agent:</strong> Analyzes online forums and discussions to find painpoints, quantify unmet demand, and identify business ideas grounded in real signals.</p>
                
                <p><strong>3) Technology PM Agent:</strong> Sources and communicates with engineers and designers to ship products, and loop in a human as required in the product lifecycle.</p>
                
                <p>As other market opportunities in the business lifecycle present themselves, we will create additional value creating nodes as needed.</p>
                
                <p>Together, these will form a closed loop that can discover, build, test, and scale 1000s of new companies repeatedly.</p>
                
                <h2>IMPACT</h2>
                
                <p>In the short term we aim to support other companies with our products, to create revenue to fuel our growth.</p>
                
                <p>In the long term, we aim to build our own set of companies.</p>
                
                <p>This is a new model of economic expansion. An engine that creates an ever-growing portfolio of companies, each addressing unmet demand with shared intelligence.</p>
                
                <h2>CONSTITUENTS</h2>
